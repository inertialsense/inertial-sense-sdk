#  Some semantics/things to note:
#  - To simplify/reduce topics names, every "level" can have a "topic" which gets appended to the previous level.
#    If a level doesn't have a "topic", or levels inbetween that don't have topics, nothing gets appended.
#      -- I'm not sure if "topic" is the best word choice, but...
#
#  - The "top" level is really about configuring the EVB/INS, subsequent levels are "object-specific" configuration.
#    In most cases, these "objects" are essentially sensor, or peripheral-specific, ie, gps1, or evb_radio.
#    Everything that is related to that "object" should be underneath that level, creating additional levels if needed.
#    Sensor objects (ins, gps1, mag, etc) will have either a "message" or a "messages" sublevel.
#    Message means there is only 1 message published for that object, and does not define a "type".
#    Messages is used when more than one message type can be published, and the label for the subsequent level is
#    the message type. Messages can have sublevels, with each type being nested under its parent type.
#
#  - There are some things that I didn't know where to put, but I think its getting close
#
#  - We will assume defaults for all parameters, and the 'example.yaml' outlines those defaults. Anything that is
#    using the default value should be commented out. As such, the actual example.yaml will have most every line
#    commented out... I think the only exception is the top-level port... and even it *could* have a default.
#
#  - each "Message" or "Messages" nodes have a "topic" element. Should this topic value default to the coded value,
#    or can it default to the parent node's name?  (ie, "raw/topic" will default to "raw".)
#
#  - I've called out specific things with FIXME's.  These should highlight in your IDE.
