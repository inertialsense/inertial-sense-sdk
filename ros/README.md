## Setup
This ROS package, uses the inertial-sense-sdk as a submodule. Clone this package into the catkin workspace `src` folder, then pull the submodule.

```bash
mkdir -p catkin_ws/src
cd catkin_ws/src
catkin_init_workspace
git clone https://github.com/inertialsense/inertial-sense-sdk
cd ..
catkin_make
```

For ROS to run properly, `devel/setup.bash` in the catkin workspace (catkin_ws) must be sourced to add necessary environment variables.  To understand more about this see the general [catkin documentation](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin).

```bash
source devel/setup.bash
```

You will need to run this command on every new shell you open to have access to the ROS commands, unless you add this line to your `~/.bashrc`.

### Important

**Firmware Version** - The IMX/uINS should be updated with the latest firmware found on the Inertial Sense [release page](https://github.com/inertialsense/inertial-sense-sdk/releases).  Download the appropriate `.hex` file and use the Inertial Sense EvalTool, CLTool, or SDK to upload the firmware.

**Dialout Group** - The user must be a member of the `dialout` group, or the user won't have access to the serial port.

## Execution

```bash
rosrun inertial_sense_ros inertial_sense_node
```

For instructions on changing parameter values and topic remapping from the command line while using `rosrun` refer to the [Remapping Arguments](http://wiki.ros.org/Remapping%20Arguments) page.  The following example shows how to set parameter using the ROS param server and run the inertial_sense_node:

```bash
rosparam set /inertial_sense_ros/navigation_dt_ms 16
rosparam set /inertial_sense_ros/msg/did_ins2/enable true
rosparam set /inertial_sense_ros/ref_lla "[40.25, -111.67, 1556.59]"
rosparam set /inertial_sense_ros/gps1_ant_xyz "[0.2, 0.0, 0.3]"
rosrun inertial_sense_ros inertial_sense_node
```

To set parameters and topic remapping from a launch file, refer to the [Roslaunch for Larger Projects](http://wiki.ros.org/roslaunch/Tutorials/Roslaunch%20tips%20for%20larger%20projects) page, or use one of the the sample launch files in this repository, `ros/launch/test_param_srv.launch` or  `ros/launch/test_YAML_params.launch`:

```bash
roslaunch inertial_sense_ros test_yaml_params.launch
```

```bash
roslaunch inertial_sense_ros test_param_srv.launch
```

## Timestamps

If GPS is available, all header timestamps are calculated with respect to the GPS clock but are translated into UNIX time to be consistent with the other topics in a ROS network.  If GPS is unvailable, then a constant offset between IMX time and system time is estimated during operation and is applied to IMU and INS message timestamps as they arrive.  There is often a small drift in these timestamps (on the order of a microsecond per second) due to variance in measurement streams and the difference between IMX and system clocks, however this is more accurate than stamping the measurements with ROS time as they arrive.  

Ideally there should be no jump in timestamps when GPS is first acquired because the timestamps should be identical.  However, due to inaccuracies in the system time, there will likely be a small jump in message timestamps after the first GPS fix.

## Topics

Topics are enabled and disabled using parameters.  By default, only the `ins` topic is published to save processor time in serializing unecessary messages.

## Services
- `single_axis_mag_cal` (std_srvs/Trigger)
  - Put INS into single axis magnetometer calibration mode.  This is typically used if the uINS is rigidly mounted to a heavy vehicle that will not undergo large roll or pitch motions, such as a car. After this call, the uINS must perform a single orbit around one axis (i.g. drive in a circle) to calibrate the magnetometer [more info](https://docs.inertialsense.com/user-manual/reference/magnetometer/)
- `multi_axis_mag_cal` (std_srvs/Trigger)
  - Put INS into multi axis magnetometer calibration mode.  This is typically used if the uINS is not mounted to a vehicle, or a lightweight vehicle such as a drone.  Simply rotate the uINS around all axes until the light on the uINS turns blue [more info](https://docs.inertialsense.com/user-manual/reference/magnetometer/)
- `firmware_update` (inertial_sense_ros/FirmwareUpdate)
  - Updates firmware to the `.hex` file supplied (use absolute filenames)
- `set_refLLA_current` (std_srvs/Trigger)
  - Takes the current estimated position and sets it as the `refLLA`.  Use this to set a base position after a survey, or to zero out the `ins` topic.1
- `set_refLLA_value` (std_srvs/Trigger)
  - Sets `refLLA` to the values passed as service arguments of type float64[3].  Use this to set refLLA to a known value.
