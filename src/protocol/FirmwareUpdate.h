    /** (DID_FIRMWARE_UPDATE) */

/*
 * The firmware_update DID type is an exchange of state and data that can be used to perform an update of a remote device's firmware
 *
 * Each packet defines a target.  Targets are hard-coded but follow a pattern, < 0xFF is Inertial-Sense, > 0xFF is 3rd-party.
 * High-nibble of LSB specifies the product, while the Low-nibble specifies a mask for which (1-4) devices to update.  Using a mask for the device allows
 * simultaneous updates of multiple, similar devices (ie, TARGET_SONY_CXD5610__1 | TARGET_SONY_CXD5610__2 can update both receivers from the same payload).
 *
 * It may become adventageous for a device to track the path (of ports) from which a request to update was received, thereby allowing for a more direct flow of
 * data between the target device and the host, without having to blindly forward data to all unknown ports.  This protocol is defined such that is should be
 * resilient to necessary changed to support this functionality, without adverse impacts on the performance or complexity of this subsystem.
 *
 * In addition to sending the actual firmware image over the wire, there are a few mechanisms to support efficient (and hopefully fast) updates to multiple devices
 * at the same time. However, care must be taken not to perform a reset of a device which is an intermediary relay (an upstream relay) to another device, since this
 * could impact communications to those downstream devices.  For example, don't reset the IMX if you're also in the process of updating the GPX and GNSS receivers.
 * The protocol is robust enough that it should be able to recover but it is strongly discouraged. Ideally, if updating multiple targets, wait until all targets have
 * finished, and received confirmation of the update being written, and then perform resets of all devices.
 *
 * The general flow of messages, when performing an update should look similar to the following (note that some devices may differ slightly):
 *
 *   Prior to the host PC sending the REQ_UPDATE message, it generates a random session-id, and specified the target slot for the GPX (1). It also populates the file
 *   size of the firmware image, specifies the session_chunk_size (the size of each transmitted chunk), and finally an MD5 hash for the entire transmitted firmware.
 *
 *   A REQ_UPDATE is sent from the host to a specific target device (ie, GPX on IG-2). Any device which receives the message is expected to forward the message to all
 *   connected ports on the device (ie, IMX receives on USB, and will resend on SER0, SER1, SER2, and on SPI (if configured)). It will NOT resend the same message BACK
 *   to the USB port.  In the IG-2, the GPX is connected on the SER0, so it will receive it on this port.  The GPX will accept both GPX and Sony GNSS messages. Since
 *   this message is for the GPX directly, it will be processed internally, and WILL NOT be forward onto any of its other ports (the GPX is the target).
 *
 *   On reception by the GPX, the GPX will respond with a RPL_UPDATE message, with the name session_id in the original message, the number of chunks that it will expect
 *   from the host (firmware size / session_chunk_size). If there are no issues with the request, the status will be set to GOOD_TO_GO.
 *
 *   Once the host receives the GOOD_TO_GO response, it will begin sending, without interruption, multiple UPDATE_CHUNK messages, in sequential, contiguous order, using
 *   the same target_device and session_id, and with incrementing chunk_id's for each message. It is assumed that as long as there is NO RESPONSE to an UPDATE_CHUNK
 *   message, that reception of that message was good, and the host will continue to send the next chunk until all chunks have been sent.
 *
 *   On the target device, when an UPDATE_CHUNK message is received, if the session id matches the session made in the original REQ_UPDATE, and the chunk_id matches the
 *   next EXPECTED chunk_id, then the chunk is written into NVME/Flash space, and an internal MD5 checksum is fed the data from the chunk. Note that the IS protocol has a
 *   higher-level mechanism to calculate/test a packet-level checksum to ensure data integrity of each message/packet.  If the session id is different, the device wil
 *   ignore the message entirely. Optionally, the device may respond with a REQ_RESEND_CHUNK to the host (it MUST make the request with the original, expected session id).
 *
 *   In the event that there is a failure to receive an UPDATE_CHUNK by the device, either due to a timeout or receiving a chunk out of sequence, the device should
 *   issue back to the host, a REQ_RESEND_CHUNK message, indicating the chunk id and the reason for the resend. Upon receiving a REQ_RESEND_CHUNK, a transmitting host will
 *   finish sending any chunk message in progress, and still stop sending any further chunks from the current sequence.  At this point, the host should resume sending a
 *   new continuous stream of UPDATE_CHUNK messages, starting with the requested id and continuing sequentially and contiguously from that id.
 *
 *   At ANY time during the update process, the device may send an UPDATE_PROGRESS message, which provides information about the status of the Update process. The message
 *   should include a chunk/total_chunk indicating, at the time the message was sent, the progress received, as well as a string message that can be displayed by the host
 *   PC to communicate status.
 *
 * From a functional standpoint, this module in comprised of 2 systems, an SDK interface, and a device interface. The SDK interface is used by the Host PC and associated
 * tool (EvalTool, cltool, etc) to initiate a request for and perform a firmware update. The device interface is instantiated on the device, and it called anytime a
 * DID_FIRMWARE_UPDATE message is received by the device, and is responsible for processing that message if it is the intended recipient, or to notify the calling interface
 * if it is not the intended target. NOTE: it is the role of the calling class to forward the incoming message to other ports, in the event that this device is not the
 * target. This is because the Device interface has no knowledge of the available ports on the specific device, as it is intended to be as device agnostic as possible.
 *
 * Note that this class/interface does not concern itself with device-specific functionality, such as managing the internal state of the device specific update mechanism,
 * nor does it deal with the actual mechanism for writing the firmware to flash.  This interface does offer a mechanism to ensure that the entirety of the firmware image
 * is transmitted correctly (hence MD5 checksum and a retry mechanism), but it does not attempt to validate the viability of the firmware image, or perform security checks
 * such as signing verification or decryption, etc. These are generally reserved for the specific device's implementation (typically OS specific) and its bootloader.
 *
 * HOW TO USE (Device):
 *   Instantiate a new FirmwareUpdateDevice() object, by passing the target ID for this device, and a pair of callback methods.  The first is the callback used to start
 *   the state machine to initiate the device for a firmware update.  The second callback is used when a valid CHUNK is received, which needs to be written to NVME/Flash.
